	5.8 compatibility.

1.19 - 2013-08-27
	* Update for modern usage, better code
	* I use this as an example in Mastering Perl, so I shouldn't
	leave embarrassing practices in the code. :)

1.17 - 2009-01-30
	* Updated the docs for the move to Github
	* There aren't any code changes

1.16 - 2007-10-27

	* updated copyright and license info

1.13 - 2006-05-17
	* Minor cleanups in docs, copyright, and pod testing. No need to
	upgrade.

1.12 - 2005-03-08
	* Added POD coverage tests.  No need to upgrade

1.11 - 2005-01-03
	* Previously, this module refused to work unless the input array had
	more than one element.  What's the point of cycling otherwise?  I've
	removed that restriction, though, because I shouldn't be the one who
	gets to decide that.  A one element array should get a chance to act
	like any other array.  It just happens to have one element.

	* Just some distribution fixes.  No need to upgrade.

0.05 - 2002-08-14
	* added reset() method for underlying object so Andy
	Lester can do HTML table tricks
	* since I was there, I added previous() and next()

	the position.
